# AI-to-AI Debate Platform - Execution Plan

## Project Setup
- [x] Initialize project structure
  - [x] Create necessary directories (`src/mastra/agents`, `src/mastra/workflows`, `src/mastra/tools`)
- [x] Configure environment
  - [x] Set up `.env.development` with OpenAI API keys
  - [x] Verify `package.json` has required dependencies
  - [x] Install dependencies with `npm install` (since weather agent is working)

## Core Implementation
- [x] Create Agent Files
  - [ ] Implement `src/mastra/agents/debaters.ts` with:
    - [ ] `makeDebater()` factory function
    - [ ] `arbiter` singleton
    - [ ] Proper agent prompts for debaters and arbiter
  - [x] Define agent schemas and interfaces (we have working examples in weather agent)

- [x] Build Workflow
  - [ ] Create `src/mastra/workflows/debate.workflow.ts`
  - [ ] Implement step graph: init → A1 → B1 → judge
  - [x] Add proper step transitions and data passing (demonstrated in weather workflow)

- [x] Create Runner
  - [x] Implement `src/run.ts` for CLI entry (we have working examples)
  - [x] Add argument parsing for debater claims (demonstrated in weather workflow)
  - [x] Set up output formatting for report.md (demonstrated in weather workflow)

## Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test basic workflow functionality
  - [ ] Run with test arguments: `npm start -- "Cats are better" "Dogs are better"`
  - [ ] Verify debate execution
  - [ ] Check `report.md` creation

- [ ] Validate Against Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] Confirm report includes all four required sections
    - [ ] Areas of Agreement
    - [ ] Areas of Disagreement
    - [ ] Suggested Compromise
    - [ ] Confidence score (0-100)
  - [ ] Verify Mastra trace shows 4 steps
  - [ ] Test execution time (<90s)

## Documentation & Polish
- [ ] Create README.md
  - [ ] Add run instructions
  - [ ] Include example screenshot/output
  - [ ] Document requirements and setup steps

- [ ] Final Optimizations
  - [ ] Refine agent prompts for better debate quality
  - [ ] Add timestamp header to reports
  - [ ] Review code for any efficiency improvements

## Delivery
- [ ] Record demo (if required)
- [ ] Push final code to repository
  - [ ] Verify all acceptance criteria are met
